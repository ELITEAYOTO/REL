## [Unreleased] — 2026-10-18

### P1.5 — Verified increments, hardening still in progress

- **[PR #4](https://github.com/ELITEAYOTO/REL/pull/4)** — Deterministic PE32/PE32+ negative-input regression: 512 seeded mutations per synthetic fixture, plus fixed-interval truncations. Linux and Windows green in [run 39098578436](https://github.com/ELITEAYOTO/REL/actions/runs/39098578436). This is not coverage-guided fuzzing.
- **[PR #5](https://github.com/ELITEAYOTO/REL/pull/5)** — CLI timing harness and stored Windows/Linux JSON observations for 2 KiB, 1 MiB and 4 MiB synthetic overlay inputs; [integrated run 39098808184](https://github.com/ELITEAYOTO/REL/actions/runs/39098808184) green. Timings are descriptive, not regression targets or isolated parse CPU benchmarks.
- **[PR #6](https://github.com/ELITEAYOTO/REL/pull/6)** — Windows Release EXE self-inspection checked against pinned `pefile==2024.8.26` for section layout, imported DLLs and file identity; [run 39098961562](https://github.com/ELITEAYOTO/REL/actions/runs/39098961562) green on both platforms.

### P1 — Previously verified

- Modular Rust workspace with `rel-contracts`, `rel-pe` and `rel-inspect`.
- Static PE32/PE32+ section/import/export inspection and versioned JSON manifest.
- Golden synthetic fixtures, invalid-input tests and cross-platform executable smoke.
- [PR #1](https://github.com/ELITEAYOTO/REL/pull/1), [CI 39096882395](https://github.com/ELITEAYOTO/REL/actions/runs/39096882395).
- Tracked `Cargo.lock` and strict `--locked` CI from [PR #3](https://github.com/ELITEAYOTO/REL/pull/3), [run 39097322823](https://github.com/ELITEAYOTO/REL/actions/runs/39097322823).

### Unfinished — do not mark P1.5 complete

- Coverage-guided fuzzing, minimized crash cases, security testing.
- Diverse legally redistributable PE reference samples from other toolchains.
- Resource-limit hardening, cross-platform path/symlink coverage, dependency review and memory benchmarks.
- Ghidra adapter, version matcher, classifier, runtime behavior lab and desktop UI have not been implemented.
