# REL — Handoff for next ChatGPT / contributor

## Repository and current state
- Repository: https://github.com/ELITEAYOTO/REL
- Source of truth: `main`; read it before suggesting changes.
- P1 alpha passed Windows/Linux GitHub CI on 2026-10-18: [run 39096882395](https://github.com/ELITEAYOTO/REL/actions/runs/39096882395), merged via [PR #1](https://github.com/ELITEAYOTO/REL/pull/1).
- P1.5 increments verified: [PR #4](https://github.com/ELITEAYOTO/REL/pull/4) mutation regression (CI 39098578436); [PR #5](https://github.com/ELITEAYOTO/REL/pull/5) CLI timings (CI 39098808184); [PR #6](https://github.com/ELITEAYOTO/REL/pull/6) Windows compiled EXE cross-check against pefile (CI 39098961562).
- The tested CLI handles two synthetic PE fixtures and its own Windows Release EXE. This **does not** establish production robustness.

## Before action
1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `README.md`, architecture and governance docs.
2. Inspect current `main` commit and open PRs/issues; don't assume files absent.
3. Keep each new tool independent; no monolithic refactor.
4. Do not regress the JSON manifest contract without a versioning ADR.
5. Implement one measurable P1.5 gate at a time; compile and verify CI on PR.
6. Update changelog and validation evidence with real run IDs.
7. Do not attempt to execute or bypass protection on current online games; use authorized offline fixtures.

## Immediate priorities
1. Cargo.lock is now tracked; keep it updated only with deliberate dependency changes and green `--locked` CI.
2. Expand reference corpus beyond synthetic fixtures and the CI-built REL Windows executable; verify each source/license.
3. Add **coverage-guided** fuzzing and persisted minimized crash regressions; deterministic mutations are already present.
4. Extend benchmarks to diverse PE complexity, peak memory, and repeatable local baselines; CLI wall-clock measurements are already present.
5. Only then start a separate Ghidra adapter in Python (P2).

## Nonnegotiable distinctions
- VERIFIED: directly observed code/test/CI result.
- DESIGN: chosen REL constraints.
- UNKNOWN: lacks sufficient evidence; preserve as unknown.
- HYPOTHESIS: explicitly labeled and accompanied by validation plan.

Future assistants must not claim these modules exist: source decompiler, version matcher, classifier, emulator or desktop UI. They remain roadmap items.
